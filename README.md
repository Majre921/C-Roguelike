# C-Roguelike

A rogue-like mini game I did for an end of year programming class project. Only 4 rooms, combat is all RNG due to behind the screen stats, made it so you mostly win everything. Really just wanted to make a game that runs in a console. That's about it.

Note: Only available in Slovak.
